        What is the project about?
        The Internet of Things (IoT) concept is pointed as a solution (or at least as a special contribution) for a myriad of societal
        problems including the most recent ones dealing with climate changes, energy production and consumption and
        sustainability in general, just to name a few. From our (smart) homes and offices to the domain of (smart) cities the
        data seamlessly collected will benefit society in general, the business community as well as local and state governments
        where new applications and innovative services can be developed towards social cohesion, a better environment and
        economy and a smarter society.
        However, nowadays, a major part of IoT proposed and already deployed IoT solutions rely on private protocols and
        private cloud services which have a huge negative impact on interoperability and data sharing across different devices,
        applications, and platforms what several researchers call “SILO OF THINGS” such as in [1].
        The aim of this project is to create a service-oriented middleware able to define an uniformization into the way data is
        accessed, written, and notified, independent of the application domain, to promote interoperability and open data
        (data is always accessed and written in the same way and applications are always created in the same way. Hence,
        anyone can access data and extend or create new applications and services always following the same format). To
        achieve that, it is proposed the adoption of Web Services and a Web-based resource structure, always based on the
        Web open standards.
