# APImanager

## What is this project?
 
A RESTful API for managing four types of resources aimed at IoT data: applications, modules, data, and subscriptions. The API allows users to retrieve information about these resources using HTTP GET requests, and to modify or delete them using POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. We implemented the API using ASP.NET and C# and tested it using a client application developed in ASP.NET Windows Forms App. In addition, we integrated the API with a broker called Mosquitto to support notifications via subscriptions. Our API provides a flexible and extensible platform for managing these resources and can be easily customized and expanded to meet the needs of various applications.
